# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The analysis of the Pyber ride-sharing app data delivers the result of total fares, drivers, rides and the average per ride and average per driver among urban, suburban and rural city types. Graphs are provided to visualize the analysis results. At the end of the analysis, recommendations are given for the CEO to review for business improvement which aim to increase the company's overall revenue.

# Results

## Results Analysis from Multi-Line Chart
From the chart below, we can visualize our analysis from the pyber summary dataframe. The yellow line represents the urban city type data, it shows the highest total fare consistently among all city types throughout the selected time period (2019 January to mid April). The red line, suburban cities, has a relatively lower amount of total fare and it fluctuates during the months from Jan to April in 2019. The blue line, rural cities, sitting at the bottom, has the lowest total fare among all city types.

# Summary
Based on the analysis above, below are some recommendations for the CEO to consider so as to address the disparities among urban, suburban and rural areas:

- Create a system of peak and off peak hours to balance revenue and take advantage of demand in various areas
- Reorganize drivers based on demand, again, to maximize revenues especially in suburban cities, during high demand periods
- Creating revenue based incentives for drivers and customers aimed to encourage more ridership as well as encourage drivers to maximize during high demand periods
